# Casino Lobby Demo

## About

This demo has been developed using the [Angular 2 Webpack quickstarter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter).

It presents a welcome page with a brief description, then is possible to navigate to the *Casino* lobby. Here, you will
find the available games divided by categories.

Using the category buttons, the user can easily navigate between the categories and see the games'thumbnails.

To enter the game window, just click on a game.

The project is based on `ngrx/store` as an implementation of the Redux pattern.

## Instructions

Clone the repo, enter the folder, and type:

    $ npm install       # grab a beer, is gonna take a while...

    $ npm start

Now head your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy.

## Testing

Although I'm not famous for testing, I manage to write a couple of them, the most significant are the ones for the reducer.

    $ npm test
